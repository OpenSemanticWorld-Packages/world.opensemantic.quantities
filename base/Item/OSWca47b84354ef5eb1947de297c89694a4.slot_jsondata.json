In the UTC time scale, a minute on rare occasions has 59 or 61 seconds; see leap second. The minute is not an SI unit; however, it is accepted for use with SI units. The SI symbol for minute or minutes is min (for time measurement) or the prime symbol after a number, e.g. 5' (for angle measurement, even if it is informally used for time).",
