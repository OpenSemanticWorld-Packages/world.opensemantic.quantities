The electric potential $\\phi(x)$ at a point, $x$, is formally defined as the line integral of the electric field taken along a path from x to the point at infinity. If the electric field is static, that is time independent, then the choice of the path is arbitrary; however if the electric field is time dependent, taking the integral a different paths will produce different results.",
