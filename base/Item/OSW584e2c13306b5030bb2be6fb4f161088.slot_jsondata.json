            "text": "Voltage is a representation of the electric potential energy per unit charge. If a unit of electrical charge were placed in a location, the voltage indicates the potential energy of it at that point. In other words, it is a measurement of the energy contained within an electric field, or an electric circuit, at a given point. Voltage is a scalar quantity. The SI unit of voltage is the volt, such that $1 volt = 1 joule/coulomb$.",
