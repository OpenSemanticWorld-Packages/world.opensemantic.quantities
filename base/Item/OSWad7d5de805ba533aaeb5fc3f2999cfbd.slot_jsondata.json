            "text": "In photometry, illuminance is the total luminous flux incident on a surface, per unit area. It is a measure of how much the incident light illuminates the surface, wavelength-weighted by the luminosity function to correlate with human brightness perception. Similarly, luminous emittance is the luminous flux per unit area emitted from a surface. In SI derived units these are measured in $lux (lx)$ or $lumens per square metre$ ($cd \\cdot m^{-2}$). In the CGS system, the unit of illuminance is the $phot$, which is equal to $10,000 lux$. The $foot-candle$ is a non-metric unit of illuminance that is used in photography.",
