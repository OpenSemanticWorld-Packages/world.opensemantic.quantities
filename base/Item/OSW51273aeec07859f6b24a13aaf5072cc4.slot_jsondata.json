            "text": "$\\textit{Permeability}$ is the degree of magnetization of a material that responds linearly to an applied magnetic field. \n  In general permeability is a tensor-valued quantity. \n  The definition given applies to an isotropic medium. \n  For an anisotropic medium permeability is a second order tensor. \n  In electromagnetism, permeability is the measure of the ability of a material to support the formation of a magnetic field within itself. \n  In other words, it is the degree of magnetization that a material obtains in response to an applied magnetic field. \n  Magnetic permeability is typically represented by the Greek letter $\\mu$. \n  The term was coined in September, 1885 by Oliver Heaviside. \n  The reciprocal of magnetic permeability is $\\textit{Magnetic Reluctivity}$.",
