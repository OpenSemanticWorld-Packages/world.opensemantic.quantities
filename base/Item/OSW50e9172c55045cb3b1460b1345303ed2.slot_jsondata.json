            "text": "\n  In chemistry the unit $\\textit{pH}$, also referred to as $\\textit{acidity}$ or $\\textit{basicity}$,\n   is the negative logarithm (base 10) of the concentration of free protons (or hydronium ions).\n  The definition of $pH$ in terms of hydrogen ions in solution is:\n\n  $$\\text{pH}=-\\log_{10}(a_{H^+})\\equiv-\\log_{10}\\left(\\left[H^+\\right]\\right)$$\n\n  Where $a_{H^+}$ is the equilibrium molar concentration of $H^+$ in the solution, the activity of\n   the hydrogen ion in the solution.\n  $$$$\n  This definition is appropriate for concentrations equal to, or less than $1\\ mol/l$, \n   where $aH+ \\equiv [H+]$, that is, $1\\ mol/L\\ HCl$ has a $pH$ of zero.\n  $$$$\n  To relate this to standard molality ($b^\\circ$), typically taken as $1 \\ mol/kg$, \n   consideration is given to the activity ($a_{H^+}$) of the hydrogen ions.\n  $$$$\n  The activity can be expressed as:\n\n  $$a_{H^+} = \\gamma_{H^+} \\times m_{H^+}$$ \n\n  Where, $\\gamma_{H^+}$ is the activity coefficient, which adjusts the molality to account for\n   non-ideal behavior due to interactions between ions in the solution.\n  $m_{H^+}$ is the molality of hydrogen ions in the solution relative to the standard molality, \n   expressed in $mol/kg$.\n  $$$$\n  The expansion of $pH$ then becomes:\n\n  $$\\text{pH} = -log_{10}\\left(m_{H+}\\times\\gamma_{H^+}\\right)$$\n\n  $$$$\n  This definition is relevant in more concentrated solutions or when precise thermodynamic calculations are required. \n  It reflects how the properties of the solution deviate from ideal behavior and provides a more accurate understanding of the $pH$ under various conditions.\n  $$$$\n  While $pH$ is a universally recognized scale for expressing hydrogen ion activity,\n  its appropriateness and accuracy can diminish under conditions of extremely high\n  ionic strength, non-aqueous environments, high temperatures, or very high or low $pH$ values.\n  In such cases, alternative measurement strategies might be required to obtain meaningful and accurate descriptions of acidity or basicity.\n  ",
