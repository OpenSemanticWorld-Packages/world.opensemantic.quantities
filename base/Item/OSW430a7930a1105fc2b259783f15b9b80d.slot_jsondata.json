            "text": "The attenuation coefficient is a quantity that characterizes how easily a material or medium can be penetrated by a beam of light, sound, particles, or other energy or matter. A large attenuation coefficient means that the beam is quickly \"attenuated\" (weakened) as it passes through the medium, and a small attenuation coefficient means that the medium is relatively transparent to the beam. The Attenuation Coefficient is also called linear attenuation coefficient, narrow beam attenuation coefficient, or absorption coefficient.",
