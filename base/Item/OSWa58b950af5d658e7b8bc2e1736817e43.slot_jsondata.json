An hour in the Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) time standard can include a negative or positive leap second, and may therefore have a duration of 3,599 or 3,601 seconds for adjustment purposes. Although it is not a standard defined by the International System of Units, the hour is a unit accepted for use with SI, represented by the symbol h.",
