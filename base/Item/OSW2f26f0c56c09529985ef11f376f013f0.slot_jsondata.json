            "text": "\"Magnetic Flux Density\" is a vector quantity and is the magnetic flux per unit area of a magnetic field at right angles to the magnetic force. It can be defined in terms of the effects the field has, for example by $B = F/q v \\sin \\theta$, where $F$ is the force a moving charge $q$ would experience if it was travelling at a velocity $v$ in a direction making an angle Î¸ with that of the field. The magnetic field strength is also a vector quantity and is related to $B$ by: $H = B/\\mu$, where $\\mu$ is the permeability of the medium.",
