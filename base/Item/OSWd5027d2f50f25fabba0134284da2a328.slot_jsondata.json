It is generally used to measure the performance of that power source. The higher the ratio, the more power a system produces relative to its weight. It's commonly used in the automotive and aerospace industries to compare the performance of different engines. It's generally measured in watts per kilogram (W/kg) or horsepower per pound (hp/lb).",
